# PATH
## Background
This is a course design for the course "Software Engineering" in Tongji University in 2018. Due to the limited time of the course, this project is not yet fully functional until the end of the course. Originally, this project is developped for IOS platform. Now this project will be rebuild on the Android platform.

## Introduction
This project aims to create an app in which the users can record a single path they have walked, skateboarded or parkoured by redefining the roads’ name and function as they like and sharing it to anyone who is using PATH. 
On the other hand, users can find those paths which have been redefined and go through it for themselves. When they are on this “redefined” path, they can see the spots the definer tagged and share their feelings after and while finishing this journey. 
What we want to do is making going outdoor more intriguing and offer people a brand-new perspective to look at the city.
